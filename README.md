# GITHUB-PROFILE-FINDER

                        ::: Find Any Github Profile and Repositories :::

If u want to deploy or clone this project than u have to add secretData.js file inside main directory.

Inside secretData.js:

``` Javascript
let secretData = {
  clientId: '',  
  clientSecret: ''
}
```

U have to set up ur own clientId and clientSecret from [Github OAuth](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
